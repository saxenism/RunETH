# RunETH | A dApp for an on-chain proof-of-workout based community 

## RoadMap:

* Twitter bot
  * To collect tweets and update the  public API about the user statistics (number of days streak went on)
* Public API
  * That will be accessed by the Oracles to verify whether the daily streak is being maintained or not

## On-going Tasks:

* Applied for a Twitter developer account. Waiting for verification. ✔️
* Explore `plumbR` to see how to create public APIs. 🚧
  * Writing the API in R, so that the twitter bot has to work in a homogeneous environment. 🤔
  * Plus, I can prototype much faster in R 🛩️
